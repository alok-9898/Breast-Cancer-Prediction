🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction System

📌 Project Overview
This project is a Breast Cancer Prediction System that uses Machine Learning to classify whether a tumor is Benign or Malignant based on medical input features.
The prediction model is built using Logistic Regression, and the system is deployed using Flask as the backend.

🎯 Objective
To build a simple and efficient machine learning-based web application that helps in predicting breast cancer using patient data.
